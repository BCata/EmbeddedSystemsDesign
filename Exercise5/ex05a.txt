start-up function launches all three tasks which block upon the p operation of the semaphore. After all tasks were launched (and soon blocked at the beginning of their execution), the semaphore releases these tasks with a broadcast operation. Since the FIFO policy is the default scheduling policy and all three tasks have the same priority, the order of task execution is the same as the launching order of the tasks.
