The output is as follows:
    Task name: Task1
    Exec time: 1321
    Task name: Task1
    Exec time: 1321
    Task name: Task2
    Exec time: 1321
    Task name: Task3
    Exec time: 1321

    Task name: Task1
    Exec time: 1322
    Task name: Task2
    Exec time: 1322

    Task name: Task1
    Exec time: 1323
    Task name: Task3
    Exec time: 1323

    Task name: Task1
    Exec time: 1324
    Task name: Task2
    Exec time: 1324

    Task name: Task1
    Exec time: 1325

    Task name: Task1
    Exec time: 1326
    Task name: Task2
    Exec time: 1326
    Task name: Task3
    Exec time: 1326

We see that Task1 is executed twice in the first release point, together 
with Task2 and Task3. This happens because, if the current release point 
has already been reached at the time of the call, the current task immediately
returns from this service with no delay. After this each task executes when is
expected.
