The tasks are all queued by the sempahore. When the sempahore is signaled it starts 
the tasks in FIFO order. Having a preemptive Priority-Based Scheduling, the kernel
saves the context for task0 and task1, allowing for task2 to start first. 
The second task is then released and then the first, based on the priorities assigned
to them.
